<h2>why im doing this</h2>
<hr/>
Ive always liked the idea of knowing how webpages worked and how they are made, also with my new career choice I've stumbled into a software that is enjoyable but my knowledge for more has grown and led me to web development. Im taking this course to hopefully earn a 2nd income. Wish me luck.
